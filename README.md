Start with

	go run hdrt/*.go

and point your browser to (http://localhost:3000). Copy the scene given in the default_scene.json file to the editor box and press render (takes a while because of default size).

## Current Issues

* ~~sphere doesn't cast shadows~~
* sphere doesn't have a reflection
* add basic object graph
* read blender files
* improve render equation to include reflection and refraction
